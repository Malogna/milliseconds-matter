    Right now it simply uses the WAF provider as a proxy.
    google.com is used as the origin.
    The request returns a 200 error from google.com due to CORS policies,
    but the response time can still be used to aproximate WAF latency.
    Control simply requests from google.com directly without a WAF as a proxy.
