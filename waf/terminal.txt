    Text approximates WAF latency for comparison purpose.
    
    The above request/response is measured. 

    Please note:
    1) The request returns a 200 error from google.com due to CORS policies, but the response time can still be used to aproximate WAF latency.
    2) The test does not take into account for performance gains/losses in WAF sharing a stack with CDN.
