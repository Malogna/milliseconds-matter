    
    Why: test is meant to demonstrate the response time improvements possible by using non-centralized web3 infrastructure and a private network backbone.
    What: test request used is a simple Solana command that returns the current transaction count on the Solana blockchain - "getTransactionCount."
    Where: test is performed on four RPC nodes; two in NA, and one in both EU and APAC. This provides a low latency experience to most web3 users on Earth.
    How: each RPC node is tested in two ways -
    connecting to the RPC node's public ip address - this routes the request from the user over the public internet to the RPC node.
    AND connecting to the RPC node's *workload* anycast ip address - this routes the request from the user to the SP// PoP that is geographically nearest to the user and then over SP//'s private network backbone to the RPC node.
    A responsive and low latency user experience for all 8 billion users in humanities span. Made with geographically localized infrastructure in user regions and seamlessly connected through a single anycast IP address.

    this all requires updating before presentation and being made public
