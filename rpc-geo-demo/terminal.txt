    This is a demonstration of a turnkey RPC endpoint network built on StackPath. 
    With it a responsive and engaging user experience is possible for all 8 billion users in humanities span.

    The first test is performed on four RPC endpoints; two in NA, and one in both EU and APAC.
    The second test uses the same endpoints, but uses an Anycast IP address that routes the request to the endpoint that is geographically nearest to the user.
    The third test uses the same Anycast IP address, but this time with a web application firewall as a proxy to provide security to the endpoint.
   
    This solution is scalable with geographically regionalized infrastructure seemlessly connected through a single anycast IP address. 
    This solution is resilient and secure with WAF protecting from bots, ddos, excess traffic, and other common failure modes.
    This solution is ready for your application.
