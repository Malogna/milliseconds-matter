    Why do milliseconds matter?

    Because maintaining the app:human sync matters.

    This all important metric is called "user engagement."

    Users engage with applications that feel responsive. 

    For a human to SYNC with an application the relationship must be low latency.

    Applications MUST respond to a user instantaneously.

    Users NEED responses as fast possible.

    400ms is the number often given as the "Doherty threshold."

    The longer the response time the more hostile to the user experience.

    Notice how maintaining attention is becoming more difficult...

    As the text slows down?

    Milliseconds matter.

    The tests on this site will help you understand latency introduced by web services.

    By improving your applications response times you can improve the user experience.
