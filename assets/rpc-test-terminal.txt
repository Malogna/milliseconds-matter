   This test requests 'getTransactionCount' from Solana RPC endpoints (five times) and records the average response times.
      Both http and https requests are tested. If an address does not respond it is removed from the test.

   Factors influencing the results of this test:
      1) Location. Geographic closeness to the requesting user is the largest factor.
      2) Network. Compute providers that have strong network peering strategies and/or their own private backbones will route user requests more effeciently.
      3) Deployment competence and architecture.
      
   This test is meaingful for applications where calls to endpoints add latency to the user experience.
   A limitation of this test is that it's run from YOUR locale - and so it does not represent all eight billion user's experience.
